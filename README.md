## Things I Gotta Do üê•

This is like a Motorola. Indestructable, and good for one thing. Logical part of it looks grand.
1. Animate resizing of grid,
2. Fix disappear animation (setTimeout carry-on),
3. Clean up CSS code so resizing (e.g. 20% to 500%) looks decent,
4. Clean up the code in general. It's so messy.
